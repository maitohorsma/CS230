**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room is a company looking to expand their web-based game, Draw It or Lose It, from their current Android platform to multiple platforms. Draw It of Lose Is is an online game that can be played in one or more teams with multiple players. In the four rounds, teams try to guess what image the computer is drawing before it is complete at one minute. The Gaming Room asked for cross-platform functionality with this request.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I was clear and concise in my desriptions, which makes the document easy to read and understand. I'm an experienced writer, so explaining myself well wasn't difficult.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

The design document helped keep things organized and managable. When there is a lot to code, and a lot of code already written that needs to be gone through, having a design document makes it easier to see what has been done, what still needs to be done, and what changes need to be made. Being able to reference the design document is easier than weeding through hundreds or thousands of lines of code. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I was docked points for not acknowleding "that even minor grammatical and spelling errors can hinder the readability of your work." I would revise those errors.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

The user needs should be at the forefront when designing software, because if they cannot use it successfully, the software will be a flop. It's important to make sure the user can actually use the software. The whole point of software is for users to use it. If it's not easy to use and understand, it won't be purchased, and clients won't be happy.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

I made sure that I was clear on what was being asked by the client. I frequently went back to re-read what they wanted from me. I didn't want to end up with a design that didn't meet their specifications. I think talking to the client and asking questions of the client is the best way to be successful in software design. Open communication is key to make sure that both parties understand what needs to get done and what has been achieved.
